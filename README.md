# SummerHacks2020 People Counter

This project is a program that can count the number of people "entering" and "exiting" on a video feed. The backend uses OpenCV and NodeJS, while the front end is built with React.
So far the React part is not linked with the OpenCV backend, but that is coming soonâ„¢.

Running run.bat (on windows devices) will open the counter program, a python "server", and a HTML page that displays counts

You will probably need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run the new frontend.
To test the Node and React front end, open two terminals inside the counter_app folder. In one run <code>node server.js</code> to start the server. 
Then in the other run <code>yarn start</code> to start the frontend.
