# SummerHacks2020 People Counter

This project is a program that can count the number of people "entering" and "exiting" on a video feed. The backend uses OpenCV and NodeJS, while the front end is built with React.

Both the number of people in the frame and the number of people who exit from each side of the frame are updated in real-time. 

Because people are identified using a YOLO-based Convolutional Neural Network which is computationally expensive, the counter for the number of people is updated every 150 frames, while the number of people exiting each side is updated immediately.

So far the React part is not linked with the OpenCV backend, but that is coming soonâ„¢.

Running run.bat (on windows devices) will open the counter program, a python "server", and a HTML page that displays counts

You will probably need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run the new frontend.
To test the Node and React front end, open two terminals inside the counter_app folder. In one run <code>node server.js</code> to start the server. 
Then in the other run <code>yarn start</code> to start the frontend.
